# Addressing Air Pollution Exposure in Nigerian Secondary Schools  
### A Case for Early Health Intervention through Data

## Project Overview
This research project investigates PM2.5 air pollution exposure in selected secondary schools in Ogbomosho, Nigeria. The goal is to measure fine particulate matter concentrations within school environments and evaluate potential health risks to students.

Children are particularly vulnerable to long-term exposure to air pollution. This study applies data collection, analysis, and visualization techniques to identify exposure levels and support early intervention strategies.

## Research Objectives
- Measure indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in school environments  
- Compare observed values with international air quality standards  
- Identify exposure risks among students  
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for environmental health intervention  
- Demonstrate how localized data supports public health decision-making  

## Methodology
- Field data collection using air quality monitoring devices  
- Measurement during classroom and outdoor school activities  
- Data analysis and statistical comparison with health guidelines  
- Environmental exposure assessment  
- Data visualization and reporting  

## Key Findings
- Some schools recorded PM2.5 levels exceeding recommended safety limits  
- Indoor pollution was sometimes higher than outdoor levels  
- Poor ventilation significantly contributes to exposure risk  
- Long-term exposure may increase future respiratory and cardiovascular disease risk  

## Data Insights
The study applies standardized air quality benchmarks to ensure comparability and policy relevance. The results demonstrate how localized environmental data can be used to inform health, education, and infrastructure decisions.

## Recommendations
- Improve classroom ventilation systems  
- Implement school-based air quality monitoring programs  
- Develop environmental data dashboards for decision-makers  
- Increase green spaces to reduce particulate concentration  
- Integrate environmental health data into policy planning  

## Tools and Techniques Used
- Environmental data collection  
- Data analysis and interpretation  
- Statistical comparison with global standards  
- Data visualization  
- Evidence-based policy analysis  

## Project Impact
This project demonstrates how data-driven environmental monitoring can:

- Identify hidden health risks in school environments  
- Support early public health intervention  
- Improve learning environments  
- Enable evidence-based policy decisions  
- Protect vulnerable populations
